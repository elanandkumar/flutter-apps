# flutter-apps
Collection of flutter apps created while learning it.

## first_app
A default app that gets created by flutter when we use `flutter create APP_NAME`. This app is a simple counter app having a button and a text. Clicking the button increments the counter.

## i_am_rich
I hope you are aware of the story behind this app. Anyway, this app does nothing and usage `Scaffold` of flutter. This is just to understand about couple of elements of Scaffold:
  - appBar
    - title
    - backgroundColor
  - body
    - image
  - backgroundColor


NOTE: More to be added as I progress and get time.
